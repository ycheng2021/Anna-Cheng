# Hello there!
My name is Anna Cheng and I am a coding student currently taking online classes. I am an UCR alumni who studied in studio art and my goal for learning coding is to work for a video game company one day.  

## My Portfolio
Project images for now will be placeholders and project links will go to other websites. 

## About Me
About me will be short since there is not much coding experience to elaborate on. Photo/avatar image will be a placeholder user icon for now.
